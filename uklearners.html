<h1 class="hacker-box" style="text-align: center;">UK Licencing process</h1>
<ul>

  <p>In the UK there is a process to go through in order to get
  your motorcycle licence. <br>

    <ol>
      <b>CBT</b> <br> 
      <br>
      The CBT (Compulsory Basic Training) is the starting point
      for anybody wishing to ride a motorcycle. <br>
      The CBT is usually a one day course costing between ¬£110 and ¬£180 
      (prices vary from training centre to training center.
      Upon passing your CBT you can ride up to a 125cc on the public 
      roads. The certificate lasts for two years and if you have not 
      taken any further training then you must complete this again. <br>
      <br>
      
      <b>Theory & Hazard Perception</b> <br>
      The Theory & Hazard Perception test costs ¬£23 
      and can be booked directly through <a href="https://www.gov.uk/book-theory-test">Gov.uk</a> website.
      The first part is a multiple choice test done on a computer in a 
      controlled environment, headphones, private booth, monitored by a DVLA official. 
      You have 57 (no idea where they pulled that number from) minutes 
      to answer 50 questions and in order to pass you must get at least 43 
      correct. <br>
      Your Hazard and Perception test is completed immediately after finishing your theory. 
      You stay sat in your booth in the test center and it will begin automatically. 
      You will sit and watch videos of people driving from the drivers perspective, 
      it is then your task to click when you spot a hazard. You will watch a total of 
      14 clips. Each clip will have at least one developing hazard, a developing hazard 
      is something that would cause you to take action i.e slowing, changing direction. 
      Your task is to click as soon as you spot the hazard. For example, a car will be 
      parked on the side of a road which is not a hazard. As you approach their indicator 
      comes on and they start to move, the sooner tou spot that indicator and click the more 
      points you get, maximum 5 per clip. My advice to anyone sitting their test is to click 
      through the hazard as it develops i.e indicator cones on *click* car starts to move 
      *click* getting closer to the car that is oulling out *click* car comes to a stop 
      because they pulled right into your path *click*. This is of course just how I done mine, 
      my theory being if you miss the full marks for any reason you still get some. 
      There are a total 75 points available during the 
      hazard and perception test and you must get at least 44 to pass. <br>

      Both the Theory and the Hazard Perception tests must be 
      passed at the same time. You will then be issues your certificate 
      and that is valid for 2 years. <br>
      <br>
      
      <b>Mod 1</b> <br>
      <br>
      Module 1 is taken in an enclosed car park and is made up of the slower manoeuvres. 
      It takes approximately 20 minutes and consists of:
      <ul> 
        Wheeling the moped/motorcycle and using the stand <br>
        Riding a slalom and figure of 8 <br>
        Slow riding <br>
        U turn <br>
        Cornering and controlled stop <br>
        Cornering and emergency stop <br>
        Cornering and hazard avoidance <br>
             
      </ul>
      For hazard avoidance and emergency stops you must pass through the speed trap at:
      <ul> 19mph on moped <br>
      31mph motorcycle <br>
      </ul>

      Upon passing the test you are giving a certificate thatis valid for 2 years 
      or until you pass mod 2, whichever comes first. <br>
      Fun Fact - For both mod 1 and mod 2 you <b><i>do not</i></b> actually need to use an instructor. 
      Whilst it is advisable to have lessons first you can book you mod 1 and mod 2 without and instructor 
      and you can use your own bike so long as it has the correct insurance, tax, mot and you can not ride it to the test center 
      yourself. Module 1 currently costs ¬£15.50. <br>
      <br>
