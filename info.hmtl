  <br>
  
  <p> To get a motorcycle licence in the UK, you'll need to complete Compulsory Basic Training (CBT), pass a theory test, and then pass a practical test (Modules 1 and 2). The specific type of motorcycle licence (A1, A2, or A) depends on your age and the type of bike you want to ride. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
1. Provisional Motorcycle Licence:
You'll need a provisional motorcycle licence, which you can apply for online or by post. 
You must be at least 16 years old to ride a moped (up to 50cc) and 17 years old to ride a motorcycle up to 125cc. 
2. Compulsory Basic Training (CBT):
CBT is a training course that introduces you to the basics of riding a motorcycle or moped.
It's not a test, but you need to demonstrate that you can ride safely to complete it.
Once you pass CBT, you'll receive a DL196 certificate, which is valid for two years.
With a valid CBT certificate, you can ride a moped (if 16 or over) or a motorcycle up to 125cc (if 17 or over) with L plates. 
3. Motorcycle Theory Test:
You need to pass the motorcycle theory test before you can take the practical tests. 
This test assesses your knowledge of the Highway Code and general road safety. 
4. Practical Motorcycle Test (Modules 1 & 2):
The practical test is divided into two modules. 
Module 1: This test focuses on„Éê„Ç§„ÇØ handling skills, such as slow riding, figure of eights, U-turns, and emergency stops. 
Module 2: This test assesses your ability to ride safely in different road and traffic conditions. 
You must pass both modules within two years of passing the theory test. 
The type of motorcycle you use for the practical test depends on the licence you are aiming for (A1, A2, or A). 
5. Motorcycle Licence Categories:
A1 Licence:
For motorcycles up to 125cc and 11kW (14.8 bhp). You need to be 17 or older to get this licence. 
A2 Licence:
For motorcycles up to 35kW (47bhp). You need to be 19 or older to get this licence. 
A Licence:
For motorcycles of any size. You can get this licence by taking a Direct Access course at 24 or over, or after holding an A2 licence for two years. 
6. Costs:
Provisional licence: ¬£34 (online) or ¬£43 (by post). 
CBT: Around ¬£130-¬£170. 
Theory test: ¬£23. 
Module 1 test: ¬£15.50.
